# eventstore

Minimal event store built on top of PostgreSQL

The goal is to demonstrate core concepts of event sourcing using a simple financial system as a case study:
- Append-only event logging
- Immutable events and versioned streams
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Transactional writes
- Event replay and aggregation
- Projections as read models

All the yada yada's have been explained [here]()
